# Introduction
This is a repo that contains something that I want to share. 

# stable_diffusion_ComfyUI_workflows
## tdxh_node_comfyui
If you use the workflows in this floder, you need to download custom_nodes form `https://github.com/youyegit/tdxh_node_comfyui`,which is customed according to my needs.
I don't guarantee that the nodes will stay the same always. Some nodes maybe have been changed so you should change something to make it work. 
## other custom_nodes
what's more, you need to download other custom_nodes that you can find on Github by ComfyUI-Manager or searching them to download manually.
Maybe you need other custom_nodes in these repositories below:
- comfy_controlnet_preprocessors
